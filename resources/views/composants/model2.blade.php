                To prevent a debacle in the European elections on June 9, President Emmanuel Macron has not ruled out confronting far-right leader Marine Le Pen in a debate. The idea of such a duel, first reported on Sunday by the newspapers Le Parisien and La Tribune Dimanche, is one of several possible scenarios, the French presidency confirmed to Le Monde. "Regarding the ways in which the president of the Republic will be involved in this campaign, everything remains open," said a source at the presidential palace. "When it comes to talking about Europe and France, we can always count on the head of state."
                
                Le Pen, reached for comment on Sunday evening, said she had "had absolutely no discussions with [Macron or his staff] about a debate." But she pointed to her previous statement, on April 21, when she told the news channel BFM-TV, "why not?" in response to a question about debating Macron. "If he proposed it to me, I wouldn't rule out taking part on principle. But above all, I'd propose a debate after the European elections, in September, to find out where he's taking us, what he intends to do with the last three years" of his term, Le Pen said on Sunday.</p>
